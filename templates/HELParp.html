        <p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) poisoning is when an attacker sends falsified ARP messages over a local area network (LAN) to link an attacker’s MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network. Once the attacker’s MAC address is linked to an authentic IP address, the attacker can receive any messages directed to the legitimate MAC address. As a result, the attacker can intercept, modify or block communicates to the legitimate MAC address.<br><br>

The term address resolution refers to the process of finding a MAC address that belongs to an assigned IP address for a computer in a network.<br><br>

The address resolution protocol (ARP) is a protocol used by the Internet Protocol (IP), specifically IPv4, to map IP network addresses to the hardware addresses used by a data link protocol. The protocol operates below the network layer as a part of the interface between the OSI network and OSI link layer. It is used when IPv4 is implemented over Ethernet.
